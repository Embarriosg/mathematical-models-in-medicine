# mathematical-models-in-medicine
Medical reinterpretation of the mathematical models from Modeling Life, implemented in SageMath.
## Modeling Life — Medicine Edition

This repository is a medical-oriented reinterpretation of the models presented in  
**_Modeling Life: The Mathematics of Biological Systems_**.

The goal of this project is to implement the same mathematical structures and modeling ideas from the book—primarily dynamical systems and differential equations—but reframed in a **medical and clinical context** rather than a purely biological one.

Instead of abstract biological populations or regulatory systems, the models here focus on medical phenomena such as:
- Tumor growth and treatment effects
- Immune system–pathogen interactions
- Glucose–insulin regulation
- Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models
- Homeostasis and feedback mechanisms in human physiology

All models are implemented using **SageMath**, with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and educational value.

This repository is intended for learning, exploration, and as a bridge between:
- mathematical modeling,
- biological systems,
- and medical interpretation.

## 🚧 Building

This project is currently under active development.

Models, documentation, and structure are expected to evolve as chapters from *Modeling Life* are progressively adapted to a medical framework.
